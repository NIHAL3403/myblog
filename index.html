            <h2>Stone Chariot, Hampi: A Marvel of Ancient Architecture</h2>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Discover the iconic Stone Chariot of Hampi, its historical significance, and architectural brilliance.</p>
            <p>The Stone Chariot in Hampi is an iconic monument located in front of the Vijaya Vittala Temple in central Karnataka. Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is renowned for its rich history and stunning architectural wonders. The Stone Chariot is a shrine dedicated to Garuda, the official vehicle of Lord Vishnu, and is one of the three most popular stone chariots in India.</p>
            <p>Built in the 16th century by the orders of King Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire, the Stone Chariot was inspired by the Sun Temple of Konark. The emperor, impressed by the Konark Sun Temple during a war with Kalinga, sought to recreate a similar marvel in Hampi. Recently, the Stone Chariot's image has been featured on the INR 50 currency notes of India, further cementing its significance.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Dive into the historical and architectural significance of the Chitradurga Fort, a fortress of legends.</p>
            <p>The Chitradurga Fort, or Chitaldoorg, is a massive fort located in the Chitradurga District, Karnataka, India. The fort was built in stages between the 11th and 13th centuries by the dynastic rulers of the region, including the Chalukyas and Hoysalas, and later expanded by the Nayakas of Chitradurga of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Nayakas of Chitradurga, or Palegar Nayakas, were most responsible for the expansion of the fort between the 15th and 18th centuries.</p>
